# Signature_Verification_Using_Siamese_CNN
 I have developedd an  automated verification system using a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  Instead of learning hundreds of thosands of signatures my model just compares if two  given signatures are similar  by passing them through twin CNN branches with shared  weights.
